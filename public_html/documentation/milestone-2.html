<h2>Duncan Colhoun's Personal Website Project</h2>

    <h3>Milestone-2</h3>

    <h3>Fullstack Cohort 34</h3>

<h2><strong>Content Strategy:</strong></h2>

    <p>The objective of my PWP is to present a one-page portfolio site for my wife's work as an illustrator of children's books.</p>

    <p>The website will have the following major elements:</p>

        <h3>Header</h3>

            <p>A prominent header with my wife's business name will top the page. It will present some
            basic information, such as her location in Albuquerque, and a photo of her. There will be a decorative wallpaper background.</p>

        <h3>Bio</h3>

            <p>Bootstrap cards underneath the header will present a short history of her artistic work.</p>

        <h3>Portfolio</h3>

            <p>A selection of photos of her work will follow. The layout will be like a "photo album" (according to
            my wife). If possible, the photos, when clicked, will expand and cover a larger portion of the viewport.
            An effort will be made to prevent the photos from being copied or downloaded.</p>

        <h3>Contacts</h3>

            <p>Below the portfolio will be a contact form.</p>

        <h3>Footer</h3>

            <p>The footer will (at this time) mainly contain copyright information.</p>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>

            <p>Please note: The final appearance of the web page will depend on my "client's" aesthetic and professional
            tastes. These wireframes are strictly tentative.</p>
