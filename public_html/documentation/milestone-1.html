<h2>Duncan Colhoun's Personal Website Project</h2>

<h3>Milestone-1</h3>

<h3>Fullstack Cohort 34</h3>

    <h3>Purpose:</h3>

        <p>This project's purpose is to showcase my progress training to be a fullstack web developer. It
            will demonstrate my skills using current front-end software. Additionally, it is an
            opportunity for me to practice building a professional portfolio website to advertise my wife's talents as
            a children's book illustrator.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>

        <p>The typical audience will be children's book authors looking to hire an illustrator and publishers looking
            to illustrate a manuscript accepted for publication. Some visitors may be librarians searching for children's
            titles that have a particular style of illustration.</p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>

        <p>My immediate goal is for this project to generate interviews for jobs in web development.
            A secondary goal is to use my pwp as a template to develop portfolio websites for my wife, her sister
            (a published illustrator) and various members of Albuquerque's fine arts community.</p>

    <h3>Persona</h3>

        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Penelope Publisher</p>

        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 52</p>

        <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Senior Publications Manager, Tiny Minds Publishing Co. New York, NY.
            She's been working there since 1992.</p>

        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Tiny Minds uses various models of Macs wirelessly networked to an Ubuntu server. Penelope is
            comfortable using her two-year-old iPad Pro, iPhone X, and her five year old XBox One S (at home). She likes to doodle
            ideas for her contract illustrators to flesh out, so she typically uses the current version of iPad's Procreate
            drawing app. </p>

        <p><strong>Attitudes:</strong> Penelope's deep experience with children's literature gives her valuable insight when it's time to select a "new
            look" for the next wave of books. She enjoys sizing up potential illustrators to hire for manuscripts her team have accepted
            and are currently editing. However, styles are fickle (unless you're Dr. Seuss). Penelope visits the website
            of the
                <a href="https://www.scbwi.org/" target="_blank">Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators</a>
            weekly to find new illustrators to check out. It's fun, she thinks.</p>

        <p><strong>Obstacles:</strong> The artwork makes or breaks the commercial success of a book. Penelope has to find an illustrator she can be
            confident hiring, but that person must be available and willing to do the story. And, Penelope isn't the only
            editor looking for fresh talent going in a new direction. </p>

        <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a highly experienced editor of children's books, Penelope expects to find
        the perfect illustrator for her current project.</p>

        <p><strong>Goals for the Site:</strong> Penelope is hoping that my web page will have a portfolio of pictures that really grab her, excite
            her, and convince her that this is the illustrator for her next book going to press.</p>

        <p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> The Society maintains a several pages of ads placed by it's members. Penelope is very familiar
            with this feature of the web site, so access to my web page will be very easy for her.</p>
