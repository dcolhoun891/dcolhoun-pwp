<h2>Duncan Colhoun's Personal Website Project</h2>
<h3>Milestone-1</h3>
<h3>Fullstack Cohort 34</h3>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This project's purpose is to showcase my progress training to be a fullstack web developer. It
will demonstrate my skills using current front-end software. Additionally, it is an
opportunity for me to practice building a professional portfolio website to advertise my wife's talents as
a children's book illustrator.</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>The typical audience will be children's book authors looking to hire an illustrator and publishers looking
to illustrate a manuscript accepted for publication. Some visitors may be librarians searching for children's
titles that have a particular style of illustration.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>My immediate goal is for this project to generate interviews for jobs in web development. A secondary goal is
to use my pwp as a template to develop portfolio websites for my wife, her sister (a published illustrator)
and various members of Albuquerque's fine arts community.</p>
