Phase 1

This is the repository for my Personal Web Project. It will hold all of my milestones and also, possibly, the final files for the project.

The PWP topic is a portfolio for my wife, who is moving into a career as a children's book illustrator. The site will be one page. 

Phase 2

This phase includes my plans for the layout of my PWP and the function of each element. There are also wireframes for the desktop and
and mobile versions of the page.
